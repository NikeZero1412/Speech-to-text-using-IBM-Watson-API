I'm sorry 
I don't want to be an imprint that's not my business 
I don't rule out contact anyone 
I should like to help everyone if possible 
Jew gentile black man white 
we all want to help one another human beings are like that 
we want to live by each other's happiness not bite of this misery 
we don't do hate and despise one another 
this world is room for everyone in the cadet this rich 
and can provide for everyone 
the way of life can be free and beautiful 
but we have lost the way 
greed has poisoned men so 
its barricaded the world with hate 
screw stepped out into misery and bloodshed 
we have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in 
machinery that gives abundance has left us and want 
how knowledge has made a cynical how cleverness hot an unkind 
we think too much field to little 
more the machinery we need humanity Marvin cleverness we need kindness and gentleness 
without these qualities life would be violent 
no one will be lost 
the airplane on the radio have brought us closer together the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men 
cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of a so 
even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world 
millions of despairing men women and children 
victims of a system that makes men torture 
and imprison innocent people 
for those who can hear me I say do not despair and misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed 
the bitterness of men who feel the way of human progress 
the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people we returned to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish 
soldiers don't give yourself the brutes 
men who despise you enslaved you who regimental lives tell you what to do what to think about the few who drill you diet to treat you like cattle useless cannon fodder don't give you a set of studies on metro man machine man with machine mines the machine hots 
you are not machines you're not Petro your man you have a love of humanity in your hearts you don't hate only be on levitate yeah I loved in the unnatural soldiers don't fight for slavery fight but nobody in the seventeenth chapter of some took it is written in the kingdom of god is within man not one man not a group of men budget all man menu you know the people have the power the power to create machines the power to create happiness do the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful to make this life a wonderful adventure then in the name of democracy there shows that power this all unite 
they just might put a New World 
decent world but would give men a chance to work but would give you the future I don't need to security by the promise of these things brutes have risen to power but they lie they do not fulfill that promise they know we know dictators pre themselves but they can save the people now it just bite the bullet bill that promise that despite the free the world to do away with national barriers to do away with greed with hate and intolerance 
but despite what a world of reason but well where science and progress will lead to all man's happiness 
soldiers in the name of democracy let us all unite
